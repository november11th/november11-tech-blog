#### Chapter 1. Asynchrony: Now & Later

- nontrivial : 적지 않은
> Practically all nontrivial programs ever written (especially in JS) have in some way or another had to manage this gap, whether that be in waiting for user input, requesting data from a database or file system, sending data across the network and waiting for a response, or performing a repeated task at a fixed interval of time (like animation).

##### now와 later 사이의 gap을 관리하는 것이 Async의 핵심이다.  

- crop up : 불쑥 나타나다.
> But most JS developers have never really carefully considered exactly how and why it crops up in their programs, or explored various other ways to handle it.
